# social_webproject-python_flask PLATO


Project plato is a python web development project done with flask library, the specification in the flask extension library were used in this project.
I have used bootstap, css, javascript, fontawesome and some other extension to design frontend and backend is completely developed by python.

Python's flask extension gives a great capability to manage login and register page. I have used `Flask-WTF` to manage login and register forms and `Flask-WTF` protects the login and register page from `CSRF` attack by using `hidden_tag()` feature. The `wtforms.validators` module in `wtforms` provides Classes like `DataRequired`, `Length`, `Email`, `EqualTo` and `ValidationError` to manage forms. The classes checks for valid username, Email and password in forms and gives alert for the user if there is any validation error. 

# User account security

 user's account security is one of the important thing to manage.  Flask library gives the flexibility to manage it. I have used `Bcrypt` class in `flask_bcrypt` to store the `hash` value of the password in the database. so, the user's password can't be access by anybody in the database.
 
 ```python
  if form.validate_on_submit():
        hashed_password = bcrypt.generate_password_hash(form.password.data).decode("utf-8")
        user = User(username=form.username.data, email=form.email.data, password=hashed_password)
        db.session.add(user)
        db.session.commit()
 ```
 
 # features in account page

  As it was a clone of social website i have developed some specification in user account page to increase the accessibilty to user.
  The account page dispalys the last visit of the user in the website and also displays the total post posted by the user in the current account. 
 ```python
    last_login =  datetime.now().strftime("%d-%m-%Y %I:%M:%S-%p")
 ```
The total post posted by the user is generated by the pagination object

 ```python
   posts = Post.query.filter_by(author=current_user).paginate()
 ```

 When a new user is registed in PLATO the account page Provied a default image to the user. The user can aslo update his profile and aslo can remove his current profile when ever he/she needs. so when the current profile removed the default image will be diaplayed in account page.
 
  ```python
  if not os.path.exists(paths):
        image_file = url_for("static", filename="profile_pics/common_dp/common.jpg")
        current_user.image_file = image_file
        db.session.commit()
        return render_template("account.html", image_file=image_file, last_login=last_login, posts=posts)
    else:      
        image_file = url_for("static", filename="profile_pics/"+ f"{str(current_user.username)}/" + current_user.image_file)
        return render_template("account.html", image_file=image_file, last_login=last_login, posts=posts)
 ```
 I have used  `PIL` library in the python to resize the image. And i have used `secrets` library to  `hash` the image name and store the  `hash` name in the database and orginal JPG image will be stored in i folder using  `OS` library in python. This will reduce the buffering in the database. I have used `SQLAlchemy` to manage database.
 
```python
 def save_picture(form_picture):
    
    random_hex = secrets.token_hex(8)
    _, f_ext = os.path.splitext(form_picture.filename)
    picture_fn = random_hex + f_ext
    directory = current_user.username
    parent_directory = "flaskblog/static/profile_pics/"
    paths = parent_directory + str(directory)
    
    if not os.path.exists(paths):
        os.makedirs(paths, mode=0o666)
    picture_path = os.path.join(app.root_path, "static/profile_pics/"+str(directory), picture_fn) 
   
    
    output_size = (800, 800) 
    image_sizing = Image.open(form_picture)
    image_sizing.thumbnail(output_size)
    image_sizing.save(picture_path)
    
    return picture_fn
 ```
