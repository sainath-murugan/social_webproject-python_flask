Python's flask extension gives a great capability to manage login and register page. I have used `Flask-WTF` to manage login and register forms. The `wtforms.validators` module in `wtforms` provides Classes like `DataRequired`, `Length`, `Email`, `EqualTo` and `ValidationError` to manage forms. The classes checks for valid username, Email and password in forms and gives alert for the user if there is any validation error.
